# Bug submitting

## Step 1: Compose the report

Submitting a bug is a critical part of the system. Here's how to do it:

When you trigger a bug submission from anywhere in the system, a modal form will open. It will request the following information:

Following fields will be filled out automatically:

* **Company Name**
* **Program Name**
* **Asset Type**
* **Assets:** You can select multiple assets within single or multiple bugs. If the bug isn't directly related to the listed assets, you can check the "Not related to listed assets" checkbox. You can also search for an asset by inputting a link and selecting the corresponding asset from the list of results. You must select at least one option.&#x20;
* **Severity:** Choose the severity of the bug. It is important to choose the severity level that is relevant to the vulnerability you have identified.&#x20;
* **Report Title:** Input a concise and informative report title.
* **Report Content:** Add a detailed description of the bug using the provided rich-text editor. Markdown is supported, allowing for formatting options such as code snippets, and more. You can preview the markdown by clicking the corresponding button.
* **Attachments (Optional):** You can attach files or URLs to the report, with a maximum of five files in total. Allowed extensions are jpg/png/pdf, with a maximum size of 10MB per file.

## How to write an ideal report

Effective bug reports are essential for identifying and resolving technical issues efficiently. Follow these guidelines to create clear and concise technical bug reports:

* **No extraneous information:**\
  Ensure your bug report contains only technical information relevant to the issue. Avoid including unrelated details, anecdotes, or non-technical content.
* **Locate and pinpoint the bug:**\
  Identify the exact location of the bug in the system or codebase. Provide specific details about where the issue occurs, including file names, line numbers, and any relevant context.
* **Use English language only:**\
  Write your bug report in English to ensure clarity and consistency in communication.
* **Utilize code snippets:**\
  Whenever possible, include code snippets that illustrate the problem. Code snippets make it easier for developers to understand and replicate the issue. Ensure the snippets are concise and relevant to the bug.

## Step 2: Double-check and confirm

Take your time to review the details of your report in the preview window. Once you submit the report, you will not have the option to make any further edits or modifications to the information provided. It is essential to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your report before finalizing the submission.

You can save the report as a draft at any time. The "Save as Draft" button will save the report as a draft and allow you to close the modal or continue editing. Your draft reports are on the Reports page -> “Drafts” tab.
