# Report thread statuses

The report thread within the bug tracking system has several statuses that help track the progress and current state of each bug report. These statuses include:

* **Bug Reported:** This is the initial status when a bug report is submitted. It signifies that the report is awaiting review and action.
* **In Progress:** The status changes to "In Progress" when an organization user or a triager begins the review process or assigns it for resolution.
* **Closed:** Reports are marked as "Closed" once they are resolved, and the bug has been addressed satisfactorily.

These statuses serve as clear indicators of the current stage of bug report processing, ensuring transparency and effective communication among participants.
