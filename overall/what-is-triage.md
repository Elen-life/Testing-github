# What is Triage?

Triage is a critical process in bug tracking and issue management. It involves the systematic evaluation, prioritization, and assignment of reported bugs or issues to ensure efficient resolution. Triage helps determine the severity and impact of each bug, allowing for appropriate allocation of resources and timely response to critical problems. Importantly, triage is essential for keeping the organization's queue free of spam and invalid reports, saving time and effort. This ensures that organization users receive prioritized bug reports and donâ€™t need to focus on spam and invalid reports, this efficiently streamlines the resolution process.

## Who are the Triagers?
