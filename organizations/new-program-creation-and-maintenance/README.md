# New Program Creation And Maintenance

In the process of creating a new program, three primary sections play distinct roles:

## 1. General Information

{% hint style="info" %}
Provide essential program details.
{% endhint %}

|                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Program name**          | In the "Program Name" field, enter a concise and descriptive name that identifies the specific program and makes it easily recognizable.                                                        |
| **Program logo:**         | Use square images to avoid cropping and deformation . Accepted formats are JPG and PNG. Maximum file size 5MB.                                                                                  |
