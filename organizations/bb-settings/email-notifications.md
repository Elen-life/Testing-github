# Email Notifications

The Email Notifications settings in the Remedy Bug Bounty platform allow you to control the types of emails you receive. Hereâ€™s how to configure them:

#### All Report Thread Emails

Select this option if you wish to receive email notifications for all activities related to report threads. This includes any updates, comments, or changes made within the report thread.

Recommended For: Team members who want to stay fully informed about all ongoing report activities.

#### Confirmed and Escalated Reports Emails Only

Choose this option if you prefer to receive email notifications only for reports that have been confirmed or escalated by Remedy triagers. This setting minimizes the number of emails by filtering out updates from non-escalated and rejected reports.

Recommended For: Team members who prefer to focus on high-priority reports and avoid cluttering their inbox with less critical updates.
