# Users

In these settings, the admin user should be able to see the team members involved in the organization account and edit their user role within the BB platform.&#x20;

There are the following user roles;

* Program Manager: This role allows the user to perform all actions with programs and reports, giving them full control over these aspects.
* Triage Manager: This role allows the user to perform all actions with reports, but their access to programs is view-only. Thus, the user with the triage manager user role will not be able to edit or create programs within the organization account.

Please refer to [this guideline ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/PCCIJdCJiCYilTfYWBxh/organizations/organization-settings)to add a new team member to the organization account.
