# Communication Within The Remedy Platform

*   **Comprehensive out-of-scope section**

    Please take time to compose a comprehensive out-of-scope section. This will help avoid low-quality reports and associated costs.
*   **Always add comprehensive explanations.**

    Provide comprehensive explanations when making decisions, such as rejecting a report, changing its severity, or taking any other action. This will help prevent misunderstandings.

    Ensure that your message addresses potential questions and clarifies the reasoning behind your decision.
*   **Prioritize prompt responses**

    Strive to respond promptly in report threads within the [provided timeframes](response-times.md). Adhering to these timeframes is highly recommended, as long delays can negatively impact the communityâ€™s perception of your business.
* **Technical support by the Remedy experts** \
  You can always reach out to us in the same report thread with pretty much any question. Whether you need bug report interpretation, technical support, or follow-ups, our team will serve your interests best.
* **Conflicts and misunderstanding**\
  Minor conflicts and misunderstandings are part of human nature. If you encounter any issues, please know that the Remedy team is here to support you. Approach these situations with understanding and patience. Your prompt and considerate response is crucial and greatly appreciated.
