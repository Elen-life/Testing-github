<details>

<summary>How do I add and manage my organization's users? !!!!</summary>

Please refer to these guidelines for detailed [Remedy User Management](https://app.gitbook.com/s/PCCIJdCJiCYilTfYWBxh/organizations/organization-settings) system instructions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The system doesn't allow me to edit or create programs </summary>

If you’re unable to edit or create programs, it’s likely due to the role assigned to your user account. The **Triage Manager** role, for example, allows you to perform actions on reports but restricts your ability to edit or create programs.

To gain access to these functions, you need to be assigned the **Program Manager** role, which allows full control over both programs and reports.

If you believe you need this access, please contact your account administrator to request a role change.

</details>

### Reports and Communication

<details>

<summary>How does our team know when a valid bug report is submitted?</summary>

The new report will also appear in the "**Pending Review**" tab on the "Reports" page.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When should our team start reviewing the report?</summary>

<details>

<summary>Can I change the severity level of the report?</summary>

If you find the report's severity level inappropriate, you can adjust it directly from the thread. If the Remedy triage team disagrees with your assessment, the reported severity may be changed after discussion.&#x20;

\*Please use the [RVSS calculator](https://remedy.hexens.com/rvss-calculator#RVSS:1.0/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:N) to determine the severity level.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I calculate the severity of the report?</summary>

Please refer to your program scope or use the [RVSS calculator](https://remedy.hexens.com/rvss-calculator#RVSS:1.0/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:N) tailored by Remedy to accurately determine the severity level of the report.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I edit/delete my message in the report thread?</summary>

You can not edit or delete your messages in the report thread. The report thread is intentionally uneditable for all users, primarily for security reasons. This serves as a crucial proof and historical record, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the communication and actions taken within the thread.&#x20;

Therefore, it's essential to exercise caution and accuracy when posting messages in the report thread, as they cannot be modified or removed once posted.

</details>

### Payouts and KYC

<details>

<summary>Do we have to pay a reward if we don't fix the vulnerability?</summary>

Yes, even if the reported vulnerability does not result in a code change, a reward is still required if the vulnerability is valid.

\*Add such cases to your program’s out-of-scope section to avoid receiving similar reports.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is payment required for the bug reports that were closed as out of scope, but our project fixed the issue anyway?</summary>

No, you are not obligated to pay a reward if a bug report submission is closed as out of scope, even if your project fixed the reported issue.&#x20;

However, it is highly recommended that the researcher's effort and contribution be acknowledged with a payout.

</details>

<details>

<summary>KYC Verification Flow on Remedy</summary>

You can select the “KYC required” option when setting up your program. KYC verification can be handled in one of the following ways:

1. **Integrated KYC Verification:** Security researchers on Remedy are welcome to complete a primary KYC verification. Once verified, the system will mark these researchers, so you won’t need to request KYC from them again.[ Please refer to this guideline for more details.](../overall/integrated-kyc-verification.md)

1) **Self-Managed KYC:** If preferred, your company can handle the KYC procedure independently. You will manage the KYC process and ensure compliance, while Remedy can assist as needed.
